When asking a question please be as verbose as possible. Try to address the following questions.

1. What do you want to achieve?
2. What kind of data do you have?
3. What have you tried so far. Attach reduced MTEX code if possible, e.g. like
```matlab
ebsd = EBSD.load('myData')
plotPDF(ebsd.orientations,Miller(1,0,0,ebsd.CS))
```
4. What result do you get / what result do you expect.
