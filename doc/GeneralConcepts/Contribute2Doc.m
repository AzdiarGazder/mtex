%% The MTEX Documentation
%
% Documenting a project like MTEX is a challenging and ongoing task for the
% entire community. To make contributions as simple as possible all MTEX
% documentation pages are essentially MTEX scripts that can by opened in
% Matlab using the command
%
%   edit hepPageName
%
% This allows you to run through all the commands yourself and investiage
% the effect of different parameters or different input files.
%
% You can also open and edit the script file directly in Github by clicking
% on
% <https://github.com/mtex-toolbox/mtex/blob/develop/doc/GeneralConcepts/Contribute2Doc.m
% edit page> at the top of each help section. This makes it extremely
% simple for every MTEX user to contribute to the MTEX documentation. Note
% that everybody who contributed to MTEX will automatically appear at the
% <https://github.com/mtex-toolbox/mtex/graphs/contributors contributors
% page>.
% 
% We are happy about any help, especialy spelling fixes.
% 
%% Publish command
%
% The documentation files are processed via the publish command which takes
% the m-file and creates an html-file. The basic syntax can be found here:
% <https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/publishing-matlab-code.html>.
% To generate a preview of your modified documentation page  type
%
%   publish filename
%
% which creates an folder, named 'html', in your current directory where
% you can find the modified documentation page.
%
%% Further processing
%
% If you made some contributions to the documentation which you think
% should be included into the official documentation you can make a pull
% request to the mtex-GitHub repository or simply send the documentation
% file and we will make sure you can admire you changes in the official
% documentation.
