%% The MTEX Documentation
%
% Documenting a project like MTEX is a challenging and ongoing task for the
% entire community. To make contributions as simple as possible all MTEX
% documentation pages are essentially MTEX scripts that can by opened in
% Matlab using the command
%
%   edit hepPageName
%
% This allows you to run through all the commands yourself and investiage
% the effect of different parameters or different input files. 
%
% Furthermore, this makes it extemely simple for every MTEX user to to
% contribute to the documentation. Simply send new or improved
% documentation scripts to the authors and we will happy to incorporate
% your changes into upcomming version. We are happy about any help,
% especialy spelling fixes.
% 
%% Publish command
%
% The documentation files are processed via the publish command which takes
% the m-file and creates an html-file. The basic syntax can be found here:
% <https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/publishing-matlab-code.html>.
% To generate a preview of your modified documentation page  type
%
%   publish filename
%
% which creates an folder, named 'hmtl', in your current directory where
% you can find the modified documentation page.
%
%% Further processing
%
% If you made some contributions to the documentation which you think
% should be included into the official documentation you can make a pull
% request to the mtex-GitHub repository or simply send the documentation
% file and we will make sure you can admire you changes in the official
% documentation.
